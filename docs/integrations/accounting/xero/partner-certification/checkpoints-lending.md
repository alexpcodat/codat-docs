For lenders that want to become Xero Partners, Xero stipulates two technical requirements to comply with: 

- Xero's [certification checkpoints](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/xero-app-store/app-partner-guides/certification-checkpoints/) that apply to all apps connecting to Xero.
- [Lending writeback](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/general-lending-integration-guide/), which is a lender-specific requirement.

## Lending writeback

The purpose of the lending writeback is to accurately maintain the financial position of a customer in Xero at any point of the lending cycle. This is typically done by recording the loan liability, any interest, fees, and repayments, and facilitating the reconciliation of the bank account. Codat offers the following guides on implementing lending write-back: 

  * [General lending writeback](https://docs.codat.io/lending/guides/general-loan-writeback)
  * [Invoice finance writeback](https://docs.codat.io/lending/guides/invoice-finance/introduction)

## Certification checkpoints

Codat handles many of the certification checkpoints for you. For those that require you to take action, we prepared this companion guide that helps you understand the steps you need to take. We also recommend that you work closely with your Codat account team during your implementation. 

## Always required

### 1. App name

**Action required: minimal**

Your app's name is visible to end users at multiple points in the customer journey and it must reflect the go-to-market name of your app or product. It cannot include the word `Xero`. You can edit your app's name in the **My Apps** section of your Xero Developer Portal.

### 2. Branding

**Action required: minimal**

You must be compliant with Xero's guidance wherever you mention your Xero Partnership or use their brand assets. To ensure that, review Xero's [Brand Guidelines](https://developer.xero.com/static/otherfiles/xero-app-partner-brand-guidelines.pdf) and [Branding how-to-guide](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/branding-your-integration/).

Xero recommends you use [their own](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/branding-your-integration/) _Connect_ and _Disconnect_ buttons, but you can use a standard set of buttons for consistency of style if your app has multiple integrations instead.

### 3. Connection

**Action required: significant**

This checkpoint assumes that your borrowers are able to manage their data connection via a digital portal you provide. This may not be relevant if:
  * You pull data once during customer onboarding and then disconnect.
  * You do not have a digital lending journey for borrowers and rely on a different approach instead (for example, emails).

  If either of these are true, communicate this clearly to Xero during your partner application. Otherwise, your digital portal UI should satisfy the following requirements:

| Requirement | Recommendations |
| :-- | :-- |
| Display the name of the tenant that has been connected | This can be retrieved from our [Get company info](/accounting-api#/operations/get-company-info) endpoint. |
| Display the current status of the connection. If disconnected, provide a button to reconnect to Xero | Use our [Get connection](/platform-api#/operations/get-company-connection) endpoint to check the `status` of the connection and use the `linkUrl` to reconnect|
| Provide a button to terminate the connection | When a user clicks on the button, use our [Unlink connection](/platform-api#/operations/unlink-connection) endpoint to disconnect from Xero. |
| Handle a disconnect from Xero's side | Use our [Data connection status changed](/using-the-api/webhooks/core-rules-types#company-data-connection-status-changed) webhook to identify when a disconnect happens. When the alert is triggered, change the connection status in your UI and display a "Reconnect" or "Connect" button. Xero recommends setting a regular daily sync of light data types so you can check each connected company's connection status every day.|
| Support one-to-one or multi-organizational connection | Codat allows your customers to select their Xero organization using the native Xero UI. You can enable them to connect to multiple organizations within Xero by creating a separate Codat company per organization. |
| Provide a disconnection process for off-boarding | Use our [Unlink connection](/platform-api#/operations/unlink-connection) endpoint to prevent further syncs or the [Delete connection](/platform-api#/operations/delete-company-connection) endpoint to prevent further syncs and querying of historically synced data. |

### 4. Error handling

**Action required: significant**

If an error occurs, your UI should communicate that fact to the user. It is best practice to provide detailed error messages or logs. Codat provides detailed error messaging for any issues with the integration, including status codes, listed in our [Status codes and errors](/using-the-api/errors).

### 5. Offline access

**Action required: none**

Our Xero integration covers the requirements of this checkpoint in full.
  
### 6. Rate limit hit management

**Action required: minimal**

You do not need to take independent action for this checkpoint, because your Codat account team will work with you to manage your rate limits. 
  
### 7. Scopes

**Action required: minimal**

Xero requires that apps only have access to the data that they need, so you should only enable scopes required to access the data relevant to your use case. We provide [a guide](/integrations/accounting/xero/partner-certification/scopes) to explain which scopes typically correspond to which use cases, and will work with you to ensure your scopes are set appropriately.  

### 8. Sign Up with Xero

**Action required: none or significant**

Implementing a Sign Up with Xero flow is not a requirement for Lending Partners as they are not required to have a listing in the Xero App Store. 
  
If you would like to be listed in the Xero App Store for go-to-market reasons, you must provide Sign Up with Xero, which requires additional development work that typically takes several days to complete. We prepared a [full guide](/integrations/accounting/xero/partner-certification/sign-up-with-xero) to the Sign Up with Xero flow.
